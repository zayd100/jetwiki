    op_year: 1991,
    op_goal: "The Gulf War (1990–1991) was a conflict triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, prompting a U.S.-led coalition to intervene under the banner of the United Nations. Central to the war was the overwhelming use of air power, marking a turning point in modern warfare. Operation Desert Storm began with a massive aerial bombardment on January 17, 1991, targeting Iraqi command centers, radar installations, airfields, and infrastructure. Over 100,000 sorties were flown by coalition aircraft, using precision-guided munitions, stealth technology (notably the F-117 Nighthawk), and extensive electronic warfare to cripple Iraqi defenses before any ground troops advanced. Air superiority was quickly established, allowing coalition forces to dominate the battlefield and minimize casualties, ultimately leading to Iraq’s retreat from Kuwait within 100 hours of the ground assault.",

    op_goal: "Operation Rolling Thunder was a sustained aerial bombing campaign conducted by the United States against North Vietnam from March 1965 to November 1968 during the Vietnam War. Its primary objective was to weaken the North Vietnamese resolve and disrupt their support to the Viet Cong insurgency in the South. Utilizing aircraft like the F-4 Phantom, B-52 Stratofortress, and A-4 Skyhawk, the U.S. dropped over a million tons of ordnance on strategic targets including supply routes, industrial sites, and infrastructure. However, the operation faced stiff resistance from North Vietnamese air defenses, including Soviet-supplied SAMs and MiG fighters, resulting in heavy American aircraft losses. Despite its scale, Rolling Thunder failed to achieve its political and military objectives, and it became a symbol of the limitations of air power in asymmetric warfare.",

Unlike earlier operations, Linebacker allowed U.S. pilots to strike a broader range of strategic targets, including supply lines, bridges, railways, and military installations in both North and South Vietnam. It marked the first time since World War II that precision-guided bombs (laser-guided smart bombs) were used extensively in combat, greatly increasing the effectiveness of the bombing runs. American aircraft such as the F-4 Phantom, B-52 Stratofortress, and A-6 Intruder played central roles in the campaign. Linebacker significantly disrupted North Vietnam's logistics and helped shift the momentum back toward South Vietnamese and U.S. forces, paving the way for renewed peace talks in Paris.",

On February 27, 2019, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) launched airstrikes near Indian military installations across the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir, deliberately avoiding casualties to demonstrate capability and restraint. During the operation, PAF fighter jets shot down an Indian MiG-21 Bison, and the pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, was captured and later released as a peace gesture. The operation was hailed in Pakistan as a successful show of deterrence and national resolve.",

The operation aimed to destroy the Egyptian Air Force while it was still on the ground, thereby gaining air superiority for the duration of the conflict. On June 5, 1967, Israel launched a surprise attack against Egyptian airbases, using a combination of fast jets and bombers. The operation was highly successful, resulting in the destruction of a significant portion of the Egyptian Air Force and allowing Israeli ground forces to advance with minimal aerial opposition. Operation Focus is often cited as a classic example of the effectiveness of preemptive strikes in modern warfare.",
